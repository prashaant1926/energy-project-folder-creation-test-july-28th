# Hypotheses

Hypotheses
H1: Transformer-based temporal models outperform traditional LSTM baselines on long-range renewable energy forecasting tasks.

H2: Multimodal input (weather + satellite imagery + historical logs) improves generalizability across regions.

H3: Incorporating uncertainty layers (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout) provides meaningful confidence intervals that correlate with real-world outages or variance.
