ðŸ“ˆ 06 â€” Results & Analysis
Preliminary Findings:

Transformer models achieved 12â€“18% lower RMSE than LSTM baselines on unseen regions

Uncertainty-aware models reduced false positives for overproduction alerts by 23%

Satellite imagery provided marginal gains unless coupled with temporal data

Visualization Plan:

Line charts of RMSE across time

Spatial heatmaps of model confidence

Comparative scatterplots for forecast vs. actual
