# Research Concept & Direction

As climate volatility increases, accurate forecasting of renewable energy production becomes critical for grid resilience. This project explores the application of advanced machine learning models—including Transformer-based architectures and probabilistic neural networks—to improve solar and wind energy forecasts under variable weather conditions.

We aim to integrate satellite imagery, historical production logs, and climate reanalysis data to model energy outputs with greater precision across geographically diverse regions.
