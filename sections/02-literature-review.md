# Literature Review

Relevant Areas Reviewed:

Energy Forecasting & Time-Series Modeling

ML in Climate Science (e.g. DeepMind’s GraphCast)

Remote Sensing for Solar/Wind Power Prediction

Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty Estimation

Key Findings:

LSTMs and CNNs have shown promising results but struggle with spatial generalization.

Few-shot learning and transfer learning are emerging techniques for location-agnostic forecasts.

Most existing datasets lack climate anomaly labels, making rare-event learning difficult.
